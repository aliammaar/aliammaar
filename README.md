## Hi, I’m Ali 👋

I’m a Ruby on Rails engineer who builds and runs production web systems end-to-end: APIs, background processing, performance, and deployments.

### What I work on
- **Backend APIs**: REST + GraphQL, clean service boundaries, predictable error handling
- **Multi-tenant access control**: scoped data access and permission-based authorization
- **Background processing**: Sidekiq workflows, batching, retries, idempotency, and distributed locking when needed
- **Performance & reliability**: profiling, query optimization, caching with Redis/Rails.cache, keeping latency stable as volume grows
- **Ops & delivery**: pragmatic automation for deploys, health checks, and observability

### Tech I use
- **Ruby / Rails**, Postgres, GraphQL
- Sidekiq, Redis, caching
- Authorization patterns (RBAC-style), audit/versioning, feature flags
- AWS and production monitoring tooling

### Track record
- Upwork: **100% Job Success** • **Top Rated Plus**
- **7,600+ hours** delivered across **10+ projects** (as shown on Upwork)

### How I like to work
- Clear communication, small PRs, measurable progress
- Strong ownership: I don’t just ship—**I operate** what I ship
- Clean code with practical tradeoffs (speed + correctness + maintainability)
